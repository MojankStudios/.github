This is a project to build an alternative decentralised authentication service for Minecraft out of the reach of Microsoft and Mojang.

## What's going on with chat reporting?

If you want a quick rundown of everything, you should watch FitMC's video on the topic, it is quite well researched and gives you an idea of the drawbacks of the new reporting system.

Minecraft mods to disable chat reporting:

| Project | Side | Modloader | Description | Download |
|---|:-:|:-:|---|:-:|
| No Chat Reports | Client, Server | Fabric, Forge | This mod strips cryptographic signatures that since 1.19 are attached to every message sent in the chat. Removing them makes it impossible to track and associate your chat messages with your Minecraft and, by extension, Microsoft account. | [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/no-chat-reports) [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-chat-reports) |
| Simply No Report | Server | Fabric, Quilt | This mod gives the option to server admins to disable chat reporting, in a non-intrusive way. It is disabled by default to let everyone decide what they want to do. | [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/simply-no-report)

## Is this legal?

To briefly summarise:

- We are not distributing any of Mojang's code.
- We are not allowing people to pirate the game.

  (the burden is on the launchers that choose to use this system to validate the player owns the game)
- Mojang goes one step further and allows users to disable authentication completely on their servers.
- Mojang does not disallow and actually encourages modifications to Minecraft.
- This is an implementation of publicly available information from sources such as https://wiki.vg.

TL;DR probably but lol who knows im not a lawyer
